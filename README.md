# gitup
A minimalist, dependency-free FreeBSD program to clone/pull git repositories.  Intended for non-developers, gitup synchronizes local copies of repositories without the additional overhead that the traditional git client needs.  Because gitup neither uses nor updates the contents of .git directories, it is not compatible with the traditional git client.
